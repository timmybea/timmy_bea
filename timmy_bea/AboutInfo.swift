At present I am seeking to expand my professional network while I wait for my immigration to be approved - something that I anticipate to happen around June 2017."

I am very good at steering discussion towards a speedy and comfortable decision, whether meeting with a client to discuss a project, or coordinating with a development team to keep a project moving towards it's completion date."
